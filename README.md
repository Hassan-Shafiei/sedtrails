# Supercharge SedTRAILS
The repository for SedTRAILS: Sediment TRAnsport vIsualization and Lagrangian Simulator

## Software architectural diagrams
- The `diagrams/c4` folder was obtained from the original [C4-PlantUML GitHub repository](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML). The folder contains some of the files required to run PlantUML, as well as a short [README.md](https://github.com/sedtrails/sedtrails/blob/main/diagrams/c4/README.md) that explains how to use the library.
- You can read more about the PlantUML syntax on the [PlantUML documentation](https://plantuml.com/command-line). They provide extensive support, which may be an overkill at the moment.
- If you have the dependencies installed already, you can simply clone the repository and get started. 
- TL;DR: the basic command to save your diagram to a PNG file: 
```shell
# Bash terminal
plantuml -tpng <file.puml>
```
