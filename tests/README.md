# Add Tests for your Code

Always add tests for your code. If you're developing with Python you can use one of the following packages to write tests:

- [Unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- [Py.test](https://docs.pytest.org/)

## Naming convention for test files:

Name your test files (at the extend it is possible) like: `test_<python_module_name>.py

## Test scenarios

An explanation on what and how to tests (unit tests) is given [here](https://aeolis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/unit-testing.html) for a different software.
